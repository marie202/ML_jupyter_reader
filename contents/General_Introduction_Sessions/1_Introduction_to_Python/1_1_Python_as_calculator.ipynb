This sections are for all users that are either completely new to programming languages at all or being new to Python. The intention is to give you as newbie a good start through this tutorial. If you are comfortable with writing code in general or if you are already experienced in coding with Python, please feel free to skip these introductory chapters.\n",

    "Although Python is a powerful programming language, we want to keep things as simple as possible at the beginning. Therefore we will learn the fundamentals by using Python as a calculator. You could either use the command line directly, an editor or one of the IDEs, that were introduced in the previous chapters to follow up. We strongly recommend to hack in the following commands and code snippets at your own. It also strengthens your skills to solve the provided exercises. If you decide to use Jupyterlab as your IDE of choice, please feel free to download this notebook or create an new notebook at your own.\n",

After some time you realise this value was wrong or you need to change it. By use of variable assigment this task takes you just a second because you only have to change the assigment itself.
